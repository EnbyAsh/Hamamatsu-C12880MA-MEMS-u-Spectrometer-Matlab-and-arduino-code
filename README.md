## set up  
1. go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software and downlode the Arduino IDE.  
2. open aduinoCodeSpectroModule.ino in Arduino IDE.  
3. in the top ribbon menue open tools -> bord -> "Arduino/Genuino Uno"
4. with the bord selected verify code my clicking the tick in the top left of the screen and once veifyed Load the code to the bord with the arrow button next to it.
5. open the tools menue again and find the Com port the bord is conected to.  
6. open matlab file and chage com port in the top of the code.
7. without a sample in run the code, once the first graph pops up put in a sample and press any key.
8. the last two graphs will pop up.
